  | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
  | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
  | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
  | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
  | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
  
  There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
  The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
  raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
